This web application aims to help people who have mental and psychological issues. Most people are uncomfortable seeking help face to face due to many reasons. This app seeks to fill this gap and connect experts with patients in several ways. First, there is a window where a patient can look for experts and clinics near him/her where they can visit physically. Secondly, the learner can request a conference video call with the experts if they are comfortable with that. Last and most importantly, if the client does not want to speak with an expert face-to-face then we create a customized audio call where the patient can speak to the expert anonymously and get help. There will also be that which has a total that allows the users to express themselves. The platform will also incorporate blog posts where experts can write blogs about some topics that revolve around mental and psychological health. The patients can read the blogs and also other experts may read the blogs to expand their knowledge. With the right partnership and enough outreach, we will organize events to sensitize and talk about mental and psychological health.

Project Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stems from our own experiences of isolation and finding support through anonymous online communities. This project aims to provide a similar safe space for others, helping them connect and heal.

Technical Details
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB

Architecture

Challenges and Learnings
One of the major challenges was implementing secure user authentication and data encryption. We used JWT for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing. Ensuring all communication was encrypted using HTTPS was crucial to maintain confidentiality and user trust.

Future Plans
We plan to further enhance the security features and expand the functionalities of the platform, including real-time chat and additional mental health resources.
